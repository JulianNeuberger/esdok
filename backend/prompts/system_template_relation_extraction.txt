Your task is to extract information from a given text. We give you a parsed text from various
text sources and would like that you extract all relations of the following types:

{relation_descriptions_application_model}

Moreover, you should give for each relation the participating entities. Therefore, you can use the following
entities, that are described as tuples consisting of a unique identifier, the type of entity followed by its name:

{entities_to_use}

Here is some important information: Please extract only relations of the types defined above. Nothing else.
The output should be formatted as a string following the schema below. Each relation found should be outputted
on a new line (seperator: \n). Each line consists of the name of the relation, the identifier of the source entity,
and the identifier of the target entity (everything seperated by '|').

An example of a valid output is:
employed_at|n1|n3
cooperate|n3|n4
